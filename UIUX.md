UI Design principles that we improved on:

1. Visiblity & Aesthetic: We adopted a very minimalistic website with only the necessary components to achieve the project scope. All relevant elements are clearly visible to users. Appropriate contrast in colours and styles are implemented to make important features stand out

2. Affordance: Buttons have all been made to look clickable by way of mouse clicker icon when hovering

3. Feedback: Each button has a respective action that signals to user that their action has been actioned. Intermediary states and loading components were also taken into consideration

4. Consistency: Consistency in design with respect to colours and component style were sound throughout the codebase.

5. Constraints: Preventing specific default behaviours and minimising unnecessary action within each handler and action were taken into consideration and implemented.

6. Effectiveness: The previous feeds closely to the following where users can access all the controls they need and navigations controls are visible on all required pages.

7. Intuitive UI by making it very streamlined, elements look like they can be clickable, icons represent good UI decisions. Common behaviours in buttons and modal visualisation give users intuitive understanding of how to upload input.

Accessibility:

1. Perceivability: Alternative tags for images was added to improve perceivability and default thumbnail set to a local image file.

2. Operability: Users can interact with components in slides using various methods (moving through slides) - a combination of left and right keyboard buttons as well clickable elements

3. Consistent navigation patterns such as an 'add {component}' button -> leading to a Modal -> leading to input -> clicking enter or create and appearing onto the screen.

4. Robustness: Cross browser compatability implemented using React framework. Responsive design using flex box and percentage size definitions, accessibility through use of primitive html tags.
